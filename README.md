# full-stack-task-tracker
## Backend Development
Back end was created with MVC architectrue using express to handle the routing and requests. Mongoose was used to connect to the Mongo Database and create the database Schema. Authorization with Json Web Tokens was used. 


## Front End development
I developed the front end of the project in 3 phases:
1. frontend from a vanilla html,css, js template served from the backend
2. front end was react with just using axios to send the requests to the backend
3. front end with react was updated to handle the axios requests with redux toolkit
full stack task tracker using Express, NodeJS, MongoDB and Mongoose on the backend. React, redux, and axios on the front end.
